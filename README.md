# VPSMonitor

This project was written in Java/Spring 4.1.5. It's designed to be a front end to control a large number of VPS's.

At this current time, it will support:
Add/Delete of new Servers
Add/Delete of IP Addresses (For Management)
Add/Delete of Monitoring Settings (Allows for ports/server itself to be determined if online, match content String)

In the later builds, JSCh will be integrated, so that commands can be run and logged all from a single interface. It was also planned for this same project to expand and integrate into the SAASCP project suite.
